ICLR Peer Review in Multiclass Classification Model (Linear SVC and Logistic Regression)

## Dataset
It is a project related to the International Conference on Learning Representation (ICLR), with a large volume of data that happened between 2017 and 2020, to be executed flawlessly. The dataset regarding the precise information on the peer reviews includes five distinct features: review id, text, confidence score, review score, and acceptance status.

## Abstract
An International Conference on Learning Representation (ICLR) proposes a challenge to the peer review to examine the status and score due to the length as well as complexity of the reviewâ€™s text. The goal of this paper is to explore the multiclass classification algorithm to predict the attributes, such as the acceptance status and review score. This study aims to find the best ML methodology that can provide the best performance in this condition. Therefore, we employ two famous classification models: Linear SVC and Logistic Regression, with the accuracy, classification report (precision, recall, f1), and confusion matrix as metrics to find out the result. Linear SVC was determined to be the best methodology since it achieved a higher accuracy rate in both predictions, while Logistic Regression just got a little less accurate.
